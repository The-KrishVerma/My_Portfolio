              <p className="mb-6">Hi, I’m Krish Verma, a B.Tech IT student at IIIT Allahabad with a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and full-stack development. I enjoy turning concepts into code, exploring cutting-edge technologies, and working on projects that challenge me to grow. My interests span across web development, scalable systems, open-source contributions, and software engineering principles.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">Beyond academics, I thrive in collaborative environments where innovation and teamwork come together. I actively explore open-source projects, participate in coding competitions, and stay engaged with the tech community. My long-term vision is to build solutions that not only solve problems efficiently but also add meaningful value to people’s lives, while seeking opportunities in internships, research, and professional growth.</p>
              <p>Outside of coding, I’m a curious learner who loves exploring how technology connects with everyday life. Whether it’s experimenting with new tools, sketching ideas for future projects, or following trends in AI, Web3, and system design, I believe creativity fuels innovation. I also enjoy sports and collaborative activities that keep me motivated, disciplined, and balanced — qualities I bring into my technical journey as well.</p>
